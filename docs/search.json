    "text": "Opening Apple Health data\nI have exported my Apple Health data using the Health app’s export functionality. We now have a folder of .xml files to deal with. Eventually I’ll switch to using my partner’s tracking data–it will be a far better proxy of the baby’s sleep habits–but she is currently at a baby class so I’ll need to grab it later.\nLet’s take a look at export.xml which I think should contain the sleep data.\nReading the first few characters of the file\n\nlibrary('readr')\nhealth_filepath &lt;- '../../data/apple_health_export/export.xml'\nhealth_file &lt;- substr(read_file(health_filepath), 1, 2000)\nprint(health_file)\n\n[1] \"&lt;?xml version=\\\"1.0\\\" encoding=\\\"UTF-8\\\"?&gt;\\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HealthData [\\n&lt;!-- HealthKit Export Version: 13 --&gt;\\n&lt;!ELEMENT HealthData (ExportDate,Me,(Record|Correlation|Workout|ActivitySummary|ClinicalRecord|Audiogram|VisionPrescription)*)&gt;\\n&lt;!ATTLIST HealthData\\n  locale CDATA #REQUIRED\\n&gt;\\n&lt;!ELEMENT ExportDate EMPTY&gt;\\n&lt;!ATTLIST ExportDate\\n  value CDATA #REQUIRED\\n&gt;\\n&lt;!ELEMENT Me EMPTY&gt;\\n&lt;!ATTLIST Me\\n  HKCharacteristicTypeIdentifierDateOfBirth                   CDATA #REQUIRED\\n  HKCharacteristicTypeIdentifierBiologicalSex                 CDATA #REQUIRED\\n  HKCharacteristicTypeIdentifierBloodType                     CDATA #REQUIRED\\n  HKCharacteristicTypeIdentifierFitzpatrickSkinType           CDATA #REQUIRED\\n  HKCharacteristicTypeIdentifierCardioFitnessMedicationsUse   CDATA #REQUIRED\\n&gt;\\n&lt;!ELEMENT Record ((MetadataEntry|HeartRateVariabilityMetadataList)*)&gt;\\n&lt;!ATTLIST Record\\n  type          CDATA #REQUIRED\\n  unit          CDATA #IMPLIED\\n  value         CDATA #IMPLIED\\n  sourceName    CDATA #REQUIRED\\n  sourceVersion CDATA #IMPLIED\\n  device        CDATA #IMPLIED\\n  creationDate  CDATA #IMPLIED\\n  startDate     CDATA #REQUIRED\\n  endDate       CDATA #REQUIRED\\n&gt;\\n&lt;!-- Note: Any Records that appear as children of a correlation also appear as top-level records in this document. --&gt;\\n&lt;!ELEMENT Correlation ((MetadataEntry|Record)*)&gt;\\n&lt;!ATTLIST Correlation\\n  type          CDATA #REQUIRED\\n  sourceName    CDATA #REQUIRED\\n  sourceVersion CDATA #IMPLIED\\n  device        CDATA #IMPLIED\\n  creationDate  CDATA #IMPLIED\\n  startDate     CDATA #REQUIRED\\n  endDate       CDATA #REQUIRED\\n&gt;\\n&lt;!ELEMENT Workout ((MetadataEntry|WorkoutEvent|WorkoutRoute|WorkoutStatistics)*)&gt;\\n&lt;!ATTLIST Workout\\n  workoutActivityType   CDATA #REQUIRED\\n  duration              CDATA #IMPLIED\\n  durationUnit          CDATA #IMPLIED\\n  totalDistance         CDATA #IMPLIED\\n  totalDistanceUnit     CDATA #IMPLIED\\n  totalEnergyBurned     CDATA #IMPLIED\\n  totalEnergyBurnedUnit CDATA #IMPLIED\\n  sourceName            CDATA #REQUIRED\\n  sourceVersion         C\"\n\n\nSo it looks like Apple use HKCharacteristicTypeIdentifier as a prefix to some data. Perhaps this is just a field name?\nLet’s parse the xml file properly and see what we have\n\n# install.packages(\"XML\") # I need this one to work with the xml files\nlibrary(\"XML\")\n\n# here are some ones that I think I might need\nlibrary(\"dplyr\")\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n# parse the xml file\nhealth &lt;- xmlParse(health_filepath)\nsummary(health)\n\n$nameCounts\n\n                          Record      InstantaneousBeatsPerMinute \n                          505685                           171703 \n                   MetadataEntry HeartRateVariabilityMetadataList \n                          144203                             2511 \n                 ActivitySummary                     WorkoutEvent \n                             410                              172 \n               WorkoutStatistics                          Workout \n                             143                               38 \n                   FileReference                     WorkoutRoute \n                              30                               30 \n                      ExportDate                       HealthData \n                               1                                1 \n                              Me \n                               1 \n\n$numNodes\n[1] 824928\n\n\nHmm, not very helpful?\nInstead of spending more time trying to parse the xml file myself, let’s turn to Google. This site seems to have some explanations of what’s going on with the Apple Watch data. It looks like indeed HKQuantityTypeIdentifier is just a prefix for a field name. There should be a field called HKCategoryTypeIdentifierSleepAnalysis which sounds like what I am after!"

    "section": "Exploring the data",
    "text": "Exploring the data\nThis blog gives a snippet that should convert the entire xml import into a dataframe. This has saved a ton of time!\n\n# https://www.johngoldin.com/blog/apple-health-export/2022-07-notes-apple-health-export/index.html\nhealth_df &lt;- XML:::xmlAttrsToDataFrame(health[\"//Record\"], stringsAsFactors = FALSE) |&gt;\n        as_tibble() |&gt; mutate(value = as.numeric(value)) |&gt;\n        select(-device)  \n\nWarning: There was 1 warning in `mutate()`.\nℹ In argument: `value = as.numeric(value)`.\nCaused by warning:\n! NAs introduced by coercion\n\n\nI don’t really understand what’s going on here yet so let’s try to pull it apart bit by bit.\nAccording to the snippet the information I should be interested in is contained in health['//Record']. Inspecting this with typeof(health['//Record']) I can see that it’s a list so let’s just grab the first element:\n\nhealth['//Record'][[1]] # remember that R is 1-indexed, unlike Python!\n\n&lt;Record type=\"HKQuantityTypeIdentifierHeight\" sourceName=\"Health\" sourceVersion=\"15.6.1\" unit=\"ft\" creationDate=\"2022-08-22 21:27:24 +0100\" startDate=\"2022-08-22 21:27:24 +0100\" endDate=\"2022-08-22 21:27:24 +0100\" value=\"6.33333\"/&gt; \n\n\nOk now we’re talking. It looks like those HKQuantityTypeIdenifiers are identified with some field called type. We also seem to have some metadata about where this data came from - seems like this entry is from the Apple Health app? We have some info about the app itself (perhaps ‘15.6.1’ corresponds to the Health app, or it could be iOS version maybe?).\nWe have a few datetime fields that I’ll need to dig into, and then a value ‘6.3333’ and a unit ‘ft’. It looks like this entry must have been when I entered my height when I first got my iPhone.\nLet’s take a look at a few more:\n\nhealth['//Record'][42:44]\n\n[[1]]\n&lt;Record type=\"HKQuantityTypeIdentifierHeartRate\" sourceName=\"Matthew’s Apple Watch\" sourceVersion=\"9.3.1\" device=\"&lt;&lt;HKDevice: 0x280934230&gt;, name:Apple Watch, manufacturer:Apple Inc., model:Watch, hardware:Watch6,11, software:9.3.1&gt;\" unit=\"count/min\" creationDate=\"2023-03-20 13:59:56 +0100\" startDate=\"2023-03-20 13:59:55 +0100\" endDate=\"2023-03-20 13:59:55 +0100\" value=\"77\"&gt;\n  &lt;MetadataEntry key=\"HKMetadataKeyHeartRateMotionContext\" value=\"0\"/&gt;\n&lt;/Record&gt; \n\n[[2]]\n&lt;Record type=\"HKQuantityTypeIdentifierHeartRate\" sourceName=\"Matthew’s Apple Watch\" sourceVersion=\"9.3.1\" device=\"&lt;&lt;HKDevice: 0x280934230&gt;, name:Apple Watch, manufacturer:Apple Inc., model:Watch, hardware:Watch6,11, software:9.3.1&gt;\" unit=\"count/min\" creationDate=\"2023-03-20 14:00:01 +0100\" startDate=\"2023-03-20 13:59:57 +0100\" endDate=\"2023-03-20 13:59:57 +0100\" value=\"77\"&gt;\n  &lt;MetadataEntry key=\"HKMetadataKeyHeartRateMotionContext\" value=\"0\"/&gt;\n&lt;/Record&gt; \n\n[[3]]\n&lt;Record type=\"HKQuantityTypeIdentifierHeartRate\" sourceName=\"Matthew’s Apple Watch\" sourceVersion=\"9.3.1\" device=\"&lt;&lt;HKDevice: 0x280934230&gt;, name:Apple Watch, manufacturer:Apple Inc., model:Watch, hardware:Watch6,11, software:9.3.1&gt;\" unit=\"count/min\" creationDate=\"2023-03-20 14:00:06 +0100\" startDate=\"2023-03-20 14:00:03 +0100\" endDate=\"2023-03-20 14:00:03 +0100\" value=\"76\"&gt;\n  &lt;MetadataEntry key=\"HKMetadataKeyHeartRateMotionContext\" value=\"0\"/&gt;\n&lt;/Record&gt; \n\n\nThree records of my heart rate, by the looks of things. I was right that our previous sourceName corresponded to iPhone Health app - clearly these three entries are from my Apple Watch.\nThe rest of the earlier snippet just looks like it’s converting these entries into a dataframe using XML:::xmlAttrsToDataFrame(). I can’t easily find documentation for this but I will search harder later. In particular I will want to see whether it has more arguments than just stringsasfactors.\nTaking a look at the dataframe we have made:\n\nsummary(health_df)\n\n     type            sourceName        sourceVersion          unit          \n Length:505685      Length:505685      Length:505685      Length:505685     \n Class :character   Class :character   Class :character   Class :character  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n creationDate        startDate           endDate              value         \n Length:505685      Length:505685      Length:505685      Min.   :   0.000  \n Class :character   Class :character   Class :character   1st Qu.:   0.365  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Median :   1.266  \n                                                          Mean   :  27.002  \n                                                          3rd Qu.:  35.696  \n                                                          Max.   :1290.000  \n                                                          NA's   :17576     \n\n\n\ndim(health_df)\n\n[1] 505685      8\n\n\nOkay so we have half a million rows and eight columns. Let’s take a look inside:\n\nhealth_df %&gt;% \n  tail(10) %&gt;% \n  glimpse\n\nRows: 10\nColumns: 8\n$ type          &lt;chr&gt; \"HKQuantityTypeIdentifierHeartRateVariabilitySDNN\", \"HKQ…\n$ sourceName    &lt;chr&gt; \"Matthew’s Apple Watch\", \"Matthew’s Apple Watch\", \"Matth…\n$ sourceVersion &lt;chr&gt; \"10.0.1\", \"10.0.1\", \"10.0.1\", \"10.0.1\", \"10.0.1\", \"10.0.…\n$ unit          &lt;chr&gt; \"ms\", \"ms\", \"ms\", \"ms\", \"ms\", \"ms\", \"ms\", \"ms\", \"ms\", \"m…\n$ creationDate  &lt;chr&gt; \"2023-10-25 15:37:04 +0100\", \"2023-10-25 17:44:53 +0100\"…\n$ startDate     &lt;chr&gt; \"2023-10-25 15:36:03 +0100\", \"2023-10-25 17:43:52 +0100\"…\n$ endDate       &lt;chr&gt; \"2023-10-25 15:37:02 +0100\", \"2023-10-25 17:44:45 +0100\"…\n$ value         &lt;dbl&gt; 27.4134, 52.6730, 20.0241, 38.7226, 22.8867, 39.6330, 58…\n\n\nWe’ve already cast our values to numeric, which is great. Looks like we have some metadata (sourceName, sourceVersion) about how the data was collected. I should take a quick glance at these fields but I can probably ignore them.\nThe type field looks to contain my different health data, so I’ll want to filter by that. unit is probably nothing I need to think about, but once I’ve found my sleep data I should just check that I can safely ignore the field.\nThen we have creationDate, startDate and endDate. I will need to cast these to datetimes (& work out how to work with datetimes in R!) and then work out how they relate to the value field for the sleep data that I am interested in. I assume that the relationship between the datetime fields and value will differ depending on type so there’s not going to be a one-size-fits-all approach here.\nIn the next post I will start to dig in to these fields!"

Does a more substantial evening ‘meal’ contribute to longer sleep?\nI have the following data sources:\n\nSQLite database from Baby Daybook app → nap data. Self-reported.\nXML files from Apple Health → nighttime sleep data. Measured on Apple Watch. Use this as a proxy for baby sleep.\nNumbers spreadsheet → additional nap data, self-reported. Use this to vibe check the data from Baby Daybook and assess it for quality and cleanliness.\n\nI’ll be using R and SQLite to bring these data sources together and try to gain some understanding.\nPlan is to stick it into this blog along the way. Likely the blog posts will be pretty short as I’ll be mainly writing and exploring the data set while the baby sleeps."
