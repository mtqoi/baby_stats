My name is Matt. I have a baby. I would like to see whether a nap later in the day corresponds to the baby (and by extension me and my partner) having a worse night's sleep. 

The project will be mainly in R and SQLite. My daily data analysis stack is Python+MySQL so I will use this project to learn some new things. It will be a nice chance to spend more time in RStudio, which is clearly the superlative IDE for my type of data work.


I don't completely expect the project to yield anything earth shattering but it is a nice excuse to do some data visualisations and practice my R. 

I'll be using self-reported data from a baby tracking app, some data we've written ourselves in a Numbers spreadsheet, and my partner's Apple Watch sleep tracking data, in an attempt to answer the following questions:


### Primary Question

  Does a late nap contribute to a worse night's sleep? 


### Secondary Questions

  Does the timing of bathtime affect sleep patterns?
  Does a more substantial evening 'meal' contribute to longer sleep?
