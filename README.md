# baby_stats
R and SQLite project. Does a late nap contribute to a worse night's sleep? 

Secondary questions:
- does the timing of bathtime affect sleep patterns?
- does a more substantial evening 'meal' contribute to longer sleep?

## Data Sources
- SQLite database from Baby Daybook app → nap data. Self-reported.
- XML files from Apple Health → nighttime sleep data. Measured on Apple Watch. Use this as a proxy for baby sleep.
- Numbers spreadsheet → additional nap data, self-reported. Use this to vibe check the data from Baby Daybook and assess it for quality and cleanliness.
