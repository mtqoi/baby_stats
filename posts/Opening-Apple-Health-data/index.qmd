## Opening Apple Health data

I have exported my Apple Health data using the Health app's export functionality. We now have a folder of `.xml` files to deal with. Eventually I'll switch to using my partner's tracking data--it will be a far better proxy of the baby's sleep habits--but she is currently at a baby class so I'll need to grab it later.

Let's take a look at `export.xml` which I think should contain the sleep data.

Reading the first few characters of the file

```{r}
library('readr')
health_filepath <- '../../data/apple_health_export/export.xml'
health_file <- substr(read_file(health_filepath), 1, 2000)
print(health_file)
```

So it looks like Apple use `HKCharacteristicTypeIdentifier` as a prefix to some data. Perhaps this is just a field name?

Let's parse the `xml` file properly and see what we have

```{r}
# install.packages("XML") # I need this one to work with the xml files
library("XML")

# here are some ones that I think I might need
library("dplyr")

# parse the xml file
health <- xmlParse(health_filepath)
summary(health)


```

Hmm, not very helpful?

Instead of spending more time trying to parse the `xml` file myself, let's turn to Google. [This site](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2020/02/apple-health-export-part-i/) seems to have some explanations of what's going on with the Apple Watch data. It looks like indeed `HKQuantityTypeIdentifier` is just a prefix for a field name. There should be a field called `HKCategoryTypeIdentifierSleepAnalysis` which sounds like what I am after!

## Exploring the data

[This blog](https://www.johngoldin.com/blog/apple-health-export/2022-07-notes-apple-health-export/index.html) gives a snippet that should convert the entire `xml` import into a dataframe. This has saved a ton of time!

```{r}
# https://www.johngoldin.com/blog/apple-health-export/2022-07-notes-apple-health-export/index.html
health_df <- XML:::xmlAttrsToDataFrame(health["//Record"], stringsAsFactors = FALSE) |>
        as_tibble() |> mutate(value = as.numeric(value)) |>
        select(-device)  


```

I don't *really* understand what's going on here yet so let's try to pull it apart bit by bit.

According to the snippet the information I should be interested in is contained in `health['//Record']`. Inspecting this with `typeof(health['//Record'])` I can see that it's a list so let's just grab the first element:

```{r}
health['//Record'][[1]] # remember that R is 1-indexed, unlike Python!
```

Ok now we're talking. It looks like those `HKQuantityTypeIdenifiers` are identified with some field called `type`. We also seem to have some metadata about where this data came from - seems like this entry is from the Apple Health app? We have some info about the app itself (perhaps '15.6.1' corresponds to the Health app, or it could be iOS version maybe?).

We have a few datetime fields that I'll need to dig into, and then a value '6.3333' and a unit 'ft'. It looks like this entry must have been when I entered my height when I first got my iPhone.

Let's take a look at a few more:

```{r}
health['//Record'][42:44]
```

Three records of my heart rate, by the looks of things. I was right that our previous `sourceName` corresponded to iPhone Health app - clearly these three entries are from my Apple Watch.

The rest of the earlier snippet just looks like it's converting these entries into a dataframe using `XML:::xmlAttrsToDataFrame()`. I can't easily find documentation for this but I will search harder later. In particular I will want to see whether it has more arguments than just `stringsasfactors`.

Taking a look at the dataframe we have made:

```{r}
summary(health_df)
```

```{r}
dim(health_df)
```

Okay so we have half a million rows and eight columns. Let's take a look inside:

```{r}
health_df %>% 
  tail(10) %>% 
  glimpse
```

We've already cast our values to numeric, which is great. Looks like we have some metadata (`sourceName`, `sourceVersion`) about how the data was collected. I should take a quick glance at these fields but I can probably ignore them.

The `type` field looks to contain my different health data, so I'll want to filter by that. `unit` is *probably* nothing I need to think about, but once I've found my sleep data I should just check that I can safely ignore the field.

Then we have `creationDate`, `startDate` and `endDate`. I will need to cast these to datetimes (& work out how to work with datetimes in R!) and then work out how they relate to the `value` field for the sleep data that I am interested in. I assume that the relationship between the datetime fields and `value` will differ depending on `type` so there's not going to be a one-size-fits-all approach here.

In the next post I will start to dig in to these fields!
