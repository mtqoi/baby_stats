My name is Matt. This is me and my baby:

I have a background in computational physics and am a data scientist by trade. 

Me and my partner would like to know what factors contribute to a good night's sleep for our baby. In particular, I would like to answer the following questions:

  Does a late nap contribute to a worse night's sleep? 
  Does the timing of bathtime affect sleep patterns?
  Does a more substantial evening 'meal' contribute to longer sleep?
  
I have the following data sources:

- SQLite database from Baby Daybook app → nap data. Self-reported.
- XML files from Apple Health → nighttime sleep data. Measured on Apple Watch. Use this as a proxy for baby sleep.
- Numbers spreadsheet → additional nap data, self-reported. Use this to vibe check the data from Baby Daybook and assess it for quality and cleanliness.

I'll be using R and SQLite to bring these data sources together and try to gain some understanding. Plan is to stick it into this blog along the way.
